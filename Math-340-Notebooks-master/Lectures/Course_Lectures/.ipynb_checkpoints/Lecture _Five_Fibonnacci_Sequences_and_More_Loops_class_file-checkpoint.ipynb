    "The unsolved mathematical problem is whether this code can run forever i.e. it is unknown whether there are any starting values $n$ which generate a sequence which goes on for forever.  Thus, an interesting associated quantity we would want to know is how many terms a given value of $n$ generates via the $3n+1$ sequence.  We call this number $L(n)$.  For example then, using our example of $n=3$ above, we have that \n",
